# Study Planner
Windows Desktop app for study time management. Supports up to 6 subjects, maximum time limit of 2 hours per subject. Customisable tones
and timetable storage locations, lightweight, and compact. 

This is an old project I began during my early days of self-taught programming (late 2015 &mdash; early2016). 
I have cleaned it up signficantly, but will not maintain it.
